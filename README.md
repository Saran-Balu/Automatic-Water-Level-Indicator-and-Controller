# Automatic-Water-Level-Indicator-and-Controller
To reduce water wastage, I have designed and constructed an automatic water level indicator and overflow controller in this mini project that will automatically turn ON and OFF the water pump by detecting the water level in the tank. In this project, I have primarily used 555 timer IC and Transistor BC547 to control the pump.
